> An Angular schematics collection to create Microsoft Teams applications.

⚠️ WIP ⚠️
 
## Usage

## Schematics

## Contributing

To test locally, run `npm test:schematics`. This will act the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but using a debug mode.

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.
